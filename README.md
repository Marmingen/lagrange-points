# Visualizing the Lagrange points

Specifically between a one solar mass object and one super-jovian to jovian mass object. Do notice that the L3, L4, and L5 points are geographically calculated while L1 and L2 are approximated by assuming $M_1 >> M_2$ (while not being necessarily true in this case). The reason for the large orbital mass is due to the L1-L2 points being too close to the orbiting body to visualize otherwise.

The top slider determines the solar mass ( $M_1$ ) in the span of $1M_\odot-5M_\odot$ while the bottom slider determines the orbital mass ( $M_2$ ) in the span of $0.001M_\odot-0.2M_\odot$.
